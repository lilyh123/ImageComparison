# Image Comparison
Brief project report: A python project that uses image processing libraries for measuring similarities between images and drawings. 
In this project, CV2 library from Python was used to make use of the ORB object that will help scoring the similarities between images. 
Additionally, image_slicer library was also imported to split the images in different parts and do the comparison by parts. Through this way, I will be evaluating each comparison to see which one is more accurate.
